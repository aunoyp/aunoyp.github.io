# Clarity

I feel so certain sometimes that I understand life.  
That I can chart my course through each major difficulty of life: love, meaning, death, and passion.  
And then the world is given to me, pared down strip by strip,  
meticulously and thoughtfully,  
by an artist or director or painter or sculptor or person who sees life more vibrantly and brilliantly than I do.  
In those moments I forget death,  
I forget the labors assigned to me.  
In those moments I aspire to see the world like them,  
not in their way but my own,  
but with such clarity and beauty that I myself find some sort of peculiar, tiny window of the world just for myself.
