# Narrative

## Coherency

Throughout and beyond this applications cycle, I have attempted to explain a new idea to someone. Most of the time, my audience walks away confused or in disagreement. This perplexes me. Did I explain my idea poorly? Or is my idea bad in itself? Or maybe they just didn't understand?

This is a fun hierarchical error problem. There are three levels in communicating an idea to someone. First, the idea itself. Second, the delivery. Third, the audience's capacity to interact with the idea. These are sequential, so an error in the first will propagate to the second and third.

In order to understand the issues in my communication, I broke down the components of "pitching" in order to think about them more thoroughly.

- Logic
  - More appropriately yet pretentiously termed *logos*
  - Logic isn't just the series of if->then statements interposed with axioms and facts. Of course, it needs to be valid and to be sound. To be valid, the structure of the argument cannot have holes in it. For example, if I want to prove that grass is green, and my argument reads
    - If the sky is blue, then the sun is yellow
    - Therefore, the grass is green
  - For validity, we assume that the sky is blue and that the if -> then relation is true (meaning that if the sky is blue then I am correct in sayin gthe sun is yellow). However, that does not have any bearing on the grass by the structure of the argument, so the argument isn't valid.
  - For an argument to be sound, then we evaluate the if -> then relations and the strength of the assumptions. If we assume that the world has
