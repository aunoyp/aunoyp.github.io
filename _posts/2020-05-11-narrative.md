# Narrative

## Coherence

Throughout and beyond this applications cycle, I have attempted to explain a new idea to someone. Most of the time, my audience walks away confused or in disagreement. This perplexes me. Did I explain my idea poorly? Or is my idea bad in itself? Or maybe they just didn't understand?

![Sketch of hierachical problem](https://aunoyp.github.io/images/05_12_2020_sketch.png)

This is a fun hierarchical reasoning problem. When I say hierarchical, I mean that there is a hiearchical structure to the process. There are three levels in communicating an idea to someone. First, the idea itself. Second, the delivery. Third, the audience's capacity to interact with the idea. Because it is hiearchical, it's unclear why I wasn't able to communicate effectively because the audience will be confused regardless of where the error originates. If it's a bad idea, or if the delivery is poor, I can't really disambiguate why I didn't get the idea across.

In order to understand the issues in my communication, I broke down the components of "pitching" in order to think about them more thoroughly.

# Primary Errors

- Logic
  - More appropriately yet pretentiously termed *logos*
  - Logic isn't just the series of if->then statements interposed with axioms and facts. Of course, it needs to be valid and to be sound. To be valid, the structure of the argument cannot have holes in it. For example, if I want to prove that grass is green, and my argument reads
    - If the sky is blue, then the sun is yellow
    - Therefore, the grass is green
  - For validity, we assume that the sky is blue and that the if -> then relation is true (meaning that if the sky is blue then I am correct in sayin gthe sun is yellow). However, that does not have any bearing on the grass by the structure of the argument, so the argument isn't valid.
  - For an argument to be sound, then we evaluate the if -> then relations and the strength of the assumptions. Is the sky being blue a good assumption? And does that lead to the sun being yellow?
  - So strictly, logic includes validity and sound reasoning, and more broadly it means reasoning. 
- Feasibility
  - Can this be done?
  - Derived from entrepreneur culture. Do I have the resources and the experience to navigate the challenges of implementation? I think defensibility (why wouldn't someone else do this) is a part of feasibility. I think mostly because the challenge of doing 'it' (pursuing the idea) will involve other people also doing 'it'.
  - Although this seems obvious if pitching a business, I think it applies to most interactions. If, for example, I want to explain how I want to be a neurologist, it's important that I have thought through the specifics. Which training will I receive, from where will I receive this training, and what will I use this training for?
  - For well trodden paths, like being a neurologist, the answers are well documented and easy.
  - For newer ideas, which I often come up with, these aren't so clear. It's important to hammer these down before going around telling people about the idea.
- Impact
  - Why would anyone care about this?
  - In my experience, this is the thing that I've cared about the least. And usually what people find the least appealing about my ideas.
  - In reflecting as to why my ideas don't have much impact, perhaps this is the problem. When I think about an idea, for example, studying computational neuroscience, I am usually guided by the novelty of it. This is a cool experiment, cool paradigm, and cool data that's never been collected before. Perhaps it will help us learn more about how neural patterns form. A common issue in these papers is that they argue that a better understanding of neural circuitry will allow us to then treat psychiatric disorders. However, although perhaps the authors and members of the neuroscience community have thought deeply about it, **I have not taken the time to think about it**.
  
These comprise the primary components of an idea. The logic of the idea, the feasibility of carrying it out, and the impact the idea will have on the world. In looking back at my ideas, it seems that impact and feasibility are the factors I consider the least in idea formulation. I think I would stand to benefit taking more time to walk through these things thoroughly. 

# Delivery

The secondary and tertiary level of idea communication, delivery and comprehension, are a lot less easy to think about. Ideally, the speaker should tailor the delivery to the audience. Because of this fluidity, I want to talk about delivery and comprehension together.

As an exercise, I took my personal statement from my medical school application and did a close read of it. You may wonder why I didn't do this before submitting it; all I have to say is that road-tripping and writing about your life didn't come as naturally to me as it did to Keroac or Beto.

Here's my personal statement:
> My approach to my life and career began with introspection. Consumed with finding my sense of purpose, I looked inside to find my place in the world. In time, I allowed myself to flow towards pursuits that resonated with me, excited me, and grounded me. The flow led me to connect with other people, to their passions and their struggles, which in turn became mine.

> My journey towards this flow started on a medical fellowship in Spain. As an Atlantis Fellow, I had an opportunity to shadow doctors at the town hospital of Teruel, Spain. In my head, I was on my first step to becoming a doctor. I intended to observe a few different departments and see which inspired my interests. My focus was “I,” and the town and its patients were only helping me make a decision.

> At first, I was unhappy in Teruel. In the hospital, I struggled to grasp the nuances in the Spanish conversations between patients and physicians. I felt alone and isolated. Near the end of the first week, one of the doctors I was shadowing, Dr. Ranera, invited me to share a coffee and jamón serrano.

> He asked me about myself, about school, and my research. Our conversation drifted to Bob Dylan and music, and its ability to connect people. We became fast friends as he took me under his wing, and I started to feel more comfortable in the hospital. I watched his interactions with the nurses and patients. He did not cut conversations short and always maintained eye-contact. His presence was magnetic. Inspired by his example, I started to pay less attention to myself and more to the people around me.

> Soon, the cultural code that was so difficult to understand became second nature. I began to adopt slang, gestures, shoulder touches, and cheek kisses. In my next rotation, I became close to Dr. Herrera, who was an oncologist. I remember the day I saw Dr. Herrera sitting with Hector, a farmer who was fond of cigarettes. At the short end of the table, I saw both faces, a pained mask and a shattered life as she told him he had lung cancer. Hector rubbed his gnarled hands on his stubble, holding back tears. Although I felt compelled to say something, it wasn’t my place. It was Dr. Herrera’s. She, with gentle strength, told Hector that they would fight, together.

> Returning from Teruel, I set out to work in the lab for the rest of the summer. While I had been accustomed to think it was a solitary place, my time in Professor Dixon’s lab subverted my expectations. We would sit by the whiteboard and draw models, argue, stare at the data, and sift through the literature. A thought solidified into a hypothesis and then bloomed into an experiment. We would test out our ideas and then start all over again. My curiosity came alive, growing in the presence of fun, rigorous thinking. By the end of the summer, I had gained an appreciation for learning from those around me.

> When I returned to school, my interests began to shift. I became interested in philosophy. As I delved deeper, I saw that many cornerstones of philosophy, memory, language, and mind converged in the brain. So, I began a crash course in neuroscience, studying the neural mechanism that underlies emotion in the lab with Dr. Salzman. As I immersed myself, I wanted to ask my own questions and began a project in my senior year.

> My project was focused on an almond-shaped region of the brain called the amygdala. The amygdala signals the presence of threats and rewards, and more recently, has been found to signal the location of these stimuli too. My hypothesis was that the amygdala combines information about reward and space to map out the world around us. This helps us navigate the world, steering us towards our morning cup of coffee and away from danger. Problems with the amygdala can interfere with processing emotions and can result in conditions like autism and schizophrenia. I hope that my work will contribute to the treatment of these neurological conditions.

> I had started my journey looking inside, expecting to find purpose. When I began to look outside, I found love and meaning. After this transition in thinking, I noticed similarities between myself and my classmates. Having struggled to find a home at Columbia, I saw that social isolation impacted the mental health of many of my peers. I began a campaign to improve student inclusion by creating a space on campus for first years to discuss their social experience and meet upperclassmen. My life began to flow between noticing the difficulties in the lives of others and my role as an agent of change to support them.

> My desire to connect and to understand has led me to medicine. To understand the relationship between one’s life and the world, between one neuron and another, between people who love one another, and to improve their lives with research and care - these are my goals

Cool! The essay aims to establish my journey from introspection to outrospection, from internal thinking to empathy and awareness. But to break down the narrative, and discuss the logic and delivery, I decided to analyze each paragraph closely. I first wrote out literally what the paragraph described, then I extracted the big picture idea the paragraph contributed, and then conceived of a visual interpretation of the flow of the logic.

![Close read of personal statement](https://aunoyp.github.io/images/05_12_2020_narrative_analysis.png)

The essay starts off well. The introductory paragraph serves as a summary of the narrative; reminiscent of a invocation before an epic poem. The narrative is succinct and follows a coherent arc. The nice circle I drew feels very appropriate!

Paragraphs 2-4 do a great job of following the arc established by the first paragraph. There is a consistent progression of the theme, and development of my character / mental state. The thematic development presents itself painlessly from the text, and does a decent job of showing (to be honest there is a bit too much telling for my liking). 

However, paragraph 5 marks the point in which the essay runs off the rails. The description of Dr. Herrera and Hector profoundly impacted me, but did not serve to advance the narrative. I visually described it as squiggles at the same point as the previous paragraph. The thematic content matched the previous paragraph, but did not clearly add a new point to the narrative. Instead it weakly described the same thing again: medicine, connection, empathy, and awareness interconnect with each another.

Paragraph 6-8 find an entirely new track and heads in a different direction entirely. The mistake comes from a natural source. My chronological narrative evolved this way, so I felt compelled to recreate the temporal order of the events. However, a good story thematically progresses regardless of the chronological truth. This understanding is so freaking ancient I feel stupid for not thinking about this. Odysseus starting in Phaeacia (the middle of the chronological story) had a function other than being bohemian!!!

In order to establish my passion for research, I damaged the integrity of the essay. Thematically, connection represents a compelling and pervasive aspect of my story. In this case, the primary idea stood strong. The delivery of the idea did not, well, deliver. Paragraph 6 retained some scraps of connection, and perhaps if the drive to understand connection led to my research interest, the passion for research could have been well integrated into the essay.

Would I need to write this again (which might be soon), I would step away from the connection theme. The reason I say this is that connection, social isolation, and empathy could be better pursued as a social worker. As a doctor, my primary job demands that I study and interact with pathology. Although I don't enjoy essays that talk about loved ones with diseases, they effectively communicate the logic of their idea. _I want to be a doctor so I can cure epilepsy_. Simple!

Ironically, I do a great job of this in my why MD/PhD essay. Here's the last paragraph:

>The early events in our lives, like the trauma of abuse and isolation, can hurt the development of our
brains. These changes can prevent us from responding to punishment and learning from our mistakes,
and lead to rejection from society. As an M.D./P.h.D, I want to be at the forefront of studying the
development of the brain and its capacity to learn and work to heal these traumas of the past. I want
everyone, despite their circumstances, to have a chance to be accepted in the world.

There it is. Many young children and adolescents deal with a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders that arise from genetic and environmental conditions. As a physician, I can work to improve their lives by providing treatment and researching the changes that occur in their brains to develop new therapies and drugs. My exposure to medicine encouraged me that I can make a difference in people's lives not just through treatment and research, but empathy as well. Ideally, a personal statement would describe the characteristics and experiences that make me a good candidate to pursue this path.

Oof. Well, this helped me understand more about myself and hopefully will inform my future writing and thinking.
