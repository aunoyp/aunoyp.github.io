# Hello!

This is how I spent my time today:

9:45 A.M: Wake up
9:45 - 11:00 am: Scroll through facebook, youtube, twitter, and instagram
11:00 - 11:30 am: Dress and walk to work
11:30 am - 12:25 pm: Eat lunch and email twins/triplets about tutoring

Cool. So 1 hour and 15 mintues were completely wasted so far. Let's try to avoid that from happening again.

How will I spend the rest of my day?

12:30 - 3:00 pm: Run Disco
3:00 pm - 3:45 pm: Clean Chianti
3:45 pm - 4:00 pm: Clean up lab
4:00 pm - 4:30 pm: Buy chicken and broccoli for dinner
4:30 pm - 5:00 pm: Put chicken into oven and rice/broccoli in cooker
5:00 pm - 5:30 pm: Look over units and send Daniel best ones
5:30 pm - 6:30 pm: P90X2

So these are all of the things that I need to do today.

What are some outstanding things?
- Send emails to Nader Sanai, Mercedes Paredes, Arnold Kriegstein (could ask to speak to the older student), Saul Kato, Kristoph, Daniel, Josh, and Hopkins Faculty and Students
- Respond to Martha, Sonia
- Read Arturo's reviews
- Read up on stuff to get involved with at UCSF
- Work on reasoning for PhD
- Work on finance theories
- Work on manifesto
- Pitching grad school (my interests)

Okay, so let's work out what my big priorities are in life and discuss how the different activities will fit into each goal.

- Be involved in knowledge creation
  - I enjoy taking on challenging problems and finding new solutions
  - The people who are involved in research pursue engaging, fascinating lives that I want to be around
  - I was born into this world, carried for my mother and cared for by both my parents
    - The OBGYN and the medical team ensured that I was brought in safely (would have died otherwise)
    - My extended family took care of me when my parents could not
    - The government extended services to protect my mom and dad from losing their jobs to take care of me
    - I was not oppressed because there are laws against racial injustice in the U.S.
  - Therefore, my existence is heavily dependent on other people caring for my well-being and the systems/institutions developed to protect my right to life and liberty.
  - As a result, I feel that it is my ethical and moral responsibility to do my best to either maintain/create systems that ensure and promote the survival and liberty of other people in society or do so directly
  - As of now, there are many problems in the world that threaten the survival and liberty of people in society
  - There is poverty, climate change, health issues, hunger, and oppression all over the world
  - It is very difficult to assess whether legal or political action changes anything in these scenarios
    - For example, pushing a bill designed to put more money into welfare programs might hurt the economy and cause people to lose jobs
    - Also, using trickle-down economics might only benefit the wealthy by redistributing wealth into the stock market, and therefore hurt the common person
    - Wars may liberate but the result in a large loss of life that could be otherwise avoided
  - In sum, it is difficult to rationalize which approach results in tangible benefits for society
  - However, knowledge, especially knowledge in combatting disease, always has a clear link to societal benefit
  - Therefore, pursuing a career in expanding the knowledge of diseases will fulfill my moral and ethical obligations, at least from a professional perspective
  - Within the healthcare profession, there are a number of different fields to pursue
  - In order to do my best work, I need a strong motivating factor to push me to do my best
  - Based on who I am, I do not have relatives or personal reasons for studying any particular disease
  - However, I do have a great deal of interest in the brain and how it works
    - I feel this way because it is very mysterious (a lot is left to uncover!!!)
    - Thinking and feeling, very important parts of our experience as people, come from the brain
    - Mental health, isolation, cognitive dysfunction, epilepsy, etc. are very debilitating and *strongly interfere with personhood*.
  - I also like thinking about development.
  - I like spending time with children
    - Children are our future and ensuring a good experience for them will help create the moral system I believe in
  - Something really beautiful is happening when a bunch of cells go through a process to create a new life
    - This process really is the secret of humans and what they are. It's all in the DNA!
  - So, my motivating factors -> my moral responsibility, my belief that biomedical research leads to increased survival, neurological and psychiatric disorders interfere with personhood, [and that children are the future.]
    - the bracketed part might not be so important
  - For these reasons, I would like to pursue a PhD in neuroscience to study human brain development
  - In order to pursue a PhD in neuroscience, I need to get into the MD PhD program
    - I will need to reapply to this program
    - I need to demonstrate engagement with UCSF and research
    - Will continue in a bit (after some coffee baby!)
