# Why does Science value BS?

## A few observations on treatment of undergraduates in the lab environment

I started in my current lab in the Fall of 2017. In the following summer, several undergraduates worked in the lab as summer volunteers. All of these students were premedical students. It was clear that they were undecided about whether or not they enjoyed research, but were determined to pursue medicine. Therefore, they had to be in the lab.

Two of these students stayed on with the lab, and are now my fellow technicians the year after graduation. Both still do not intend to pursue graduate school, and both are aiming to apply to medical school in the following year. They have contributed heavily to projects over their two year stints with the lab, and are now rapidly evolving as full time researchers.

I spend a lot of time with their mentors, and I speak with them regularly about their thoughts on their students. It is clear that all of the technicians, with the exception of myself, are technically sound, diligent, precise, and methodical. They are robust and learn quickly, and are now enormous contributors of value. In many senses of the word, they have become really great young scientists.

On the other hand, I am not diligent, precise, nor methodical. I work in large bursts of panicked effort, and produce at the expense of sleep, exercise, and general health. I have gained respect in the lab due to my overconfidence and inflated resume, which tricks people into taking me more seriously than they should. What would be best fo rmy development would be to work as my fellow technicians have, keeping my mouth shut.

When I ask mentors about that, they mention that the students don't seem interested in pursuing research. As I mentioned, it was clear that these students wanted to pursue a medical education. Grad school was a potential option if things didn't work out. However, this attitude disturbed me. Wouldn't it be possible that this perception that they weren't interested was precisely the thing keeping them from research?

I thought back to the experiences that led me to science. It was a conflation of desire to achieve in high school, hard work and diligence. For months I forced myself to commute between school, lab, and football/basketball practice. I would leave class as early as possible, hop into the car my parents had lost a bet to purchase for me, and then repeat Invictus until I reached work. Then I would set up 96 well plates of serial dilutions, testing combinations of yeast knockouts and chemotherapeutics to screen yeast mutants for chemotherapeutic resistance or sensitization. This would take hours of slowly pumping down the multichannel pipette with my thumb at least 8 times to ensure mixing for each column or row, for each drug, for each dilution. After I finished, I popped back into the car for what was left of football practice or basketball. Some nights we played games so I would drive straight there.

What drove me to do such an insane thing? Social pressure, parental pressure, internal pressure. None of it was good for me. However, in the process I developed a taste for science. Not any part of the failures or successes, of the rigorous thinking and re-thinking, but simply the pipetting. When my first PCR worked, I was overjoyed. When I thought I found a result no-one had found before (I had made a pipetting error), I pumped my first in the air. The work was mine, and I was responsible for it. No other endeavor had put me in such a position.

Throughout science, I struggled with most of my mentors. If I felt my time being used for something menial, I usually balked and eventually quit. The independence of the work became the most appealing part of science for me, something that was challenged when I returned to Stanford for a summer of research. With a mentor that understood how to channel my energy, I felt like part of a team. We battled over conclusions and papers and findings, but we did it together and I came to love the thinking and reasoning of science.

All of this to say - I never joined science because I loved lipid peroxidases or synapses. I loved the process, the people, and the independence. Now I spend most of my time reading papers and working on analyses, and others in the lab consider me more "interested" than other members. But why? My entry was identical to theirs, albeit earlier in my life. 

I speak up in lab meeting because I am more confident than knowledgable. I pursue big projects and ideas like a magpie, without the reservation and forethought of a wiser man. Yet somehow these are the things that predict my future value or my future trajectory.
