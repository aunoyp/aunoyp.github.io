Friday June 26th

There are three weeks until I say goodbye to this place. I'm not sure I could have ever called it home, but I know that is my own doing. In many ways, I have been a visitor. The luckiest visitor there ever was. My time in New York changed everything about me, and at the same time returned me to my old self.

My journey began as a cock-sure, ambitious 18 year old. But most of my growth at Columbia had nothing to do with New York. By the time I left, I had matured emotionally. At the peak of my powers, I moved north 23 streets to the corner of Broadway and 139th street. Right across from NY's #1 Sex Shop, my displacement squarely placed me in real life. The first month or two simply taught me that I couldn't hide in the lab every day for the whole week. Life, to me, could not be reduced to working, eating, returning to my battery charger of a room, and leaving a slightly less energized battery.

At the same time, my interviews stagnated my growth. Time became split into two phases: prep phase and interview phase. Prep phrase consisted mostly of sleeping, and interviewing meant I could not grow, but instead demonstrate who I had become. This process stymied all potential growth, friendship, enjoyment, curiousity, and adventure from my life. Without these things, what is the point?

Perhaps in the strangest inversion of all, my personality which was entirely about focusing on other people became wholly focused on myself. I wasn't able to attend Center for Justice Meetings, I wasn't able to plan curriculum for incarcerated students, and I couldn't continue to work on CU@Home or the other initiatives I had worked so hard to start during my undergraduate days.
