Why don't people vote?
- They feel disillusioned
  - People who are on the far left
  - People who are poor
  - People who the system does not work for
- They are not registered
  - 25% of people are not registered
  - out of 250 million, 130 million voted (a little over 50%)
  - That means that we're missing 25% of people who are registered, and 25% are experiencing apathy
- They forgot
