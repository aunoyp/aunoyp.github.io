Writing can serve many purposes. In my case, I write mostly to help myself think aloud. Although I like to think of myself as a fast thinker, I am not a very deep thinker. My brain train can shoot out on the rails but doesn't always have a clear destination. The best description of myself, in my esteemed opinion, comes from Lakon, a friend I made during a medical fellowship in Spain. On a bus to Valencia, she heard me blabber on about something, and said, "Huh. Aunoy, I think you're a restless person."

Perhaps it was her southern accent, or the clarity with which she christened me, but I haven't forgotten it since. Fittingly the name of the blog, and more ironically my name, pay an homage to this part of myself articulated by Lakon Shelby Thurman. It's definitely not some fanfic reference to Harry Potter either. My name, Aunoy, is derived from the Bengali word 'Onneshan,' which can be best be translated as a poetic form of discovery, e.g. inquiry. Because my name is abbreviated, the name now acts similarly to the diminutive -ito in Spanish or -\*y for names like Tim -> Timmy or Joe - Joey.

When I was little, I was _little scientist_. But to me, I think _little seeker_ fits better. Some part of me is restless, whether to avoid boredom, find purpose, or learn something new. I hope this space gives me a chance to do this, and maybe will inspire some restlessness in you.

I have been accused of pretentious writing, and I will try my best to avoid it in these posts. But I will finish with my favorite quote from my favorite philosopher (I also don't espouse hatred of pious people):

> Among some pious people I found a hatred of reason and was well disposed to them for that; for this at least betrayed their bad intellectual conscience. But to stand in the midst of this rerum concordia discors and of this whole marvelous uncertainty and rich ambiguity of existence without questioning, without trembling with the craving and the rapture of such questioning, without at least hating the person who questions, perhaps even finding him faintly amusingâ€”that is what I feel to be contemptible, and this is the feeling for which I look first in everybody. Some folly keeps persuading me that every human being has this feeling, simply because he is human. This is my type of injustice.
