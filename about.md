## Bio

I was born in Mountain View, CA and grew up in the South Bay. My parents immigrated to the United States from Bangladesh in the early 90's. My dad, the eldest of 6 children, attended BUET and worked as a tech consultant while he applied to Master's programs in the U.S. While at BUET, he fell for my mom while helping her insert punch-cards in the computer lab. He earned a teaching assistantship, which paid $600 a month, to study at the University of New Mexico in Albequerque. Although my mom had earned a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering, she came along and helped earn as a babysitter and cashier. They fondly remember their car, notably missing a side door.

My dad eventually took a job in Sunnyvale, CA while my mom was pregnant with me. We lived in a small apartment with carpet flooring, very little furniture, decor, or color. There are pictures of me sitting on the muted carpet in a flannel shirt with overalls, exercising caution of the camera, and adorning a stack of paper plates on my head. As my dad made more money, we eventually moved to a small house in Cupertino. My sister joined us a year and ten months later, and we were free to live and explore the backyard. A giant palm tree stood in the center, with a small lawn to run around and a stone patio for our parents to sit and watch. My mom went back to school to earn her master's degree in Computer Science, and once both parents were working in tech, we started living considerably better.

I had been born with asthma, and as I got older I struggled to keep up with the other kids when we played outside. Our peditrician referred us to an allergist, who suggested I be more involved in sports to strengthen my lungs. Suddenly I was playing basketball, soccer, football, volleyball, baseball, and karate. At the same time, my dad pushed me to learn advanced math from an early age. We would sit at a large table while he taught me multiplication, geometry, and algebra several years before I learned in school. While I'm not sure if I had any aptitude, the practice prepared me for classes. Teachers thought I was gifted and put me into advanced classes, which separated me from the other kids.

It was in the classroom my mischeivous nature developed. As much as I was a teacher's pet, I was also a class clown. I enjoyed the attention, I'm sure, and got along with many of my peers as a result. My attitude and activities remained the same throughout middle school and high school, and by my sophomore summer in high school I was doing well in my classes, was the quarterback for the JV Football team and the captain of the JV Basketball team.
